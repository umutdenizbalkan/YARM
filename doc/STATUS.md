## 1. Per-architecture status

### 1.1 AArch64 (QEMU virt — primary)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Core service-chain spawns | ✅ initramfs_srv / devfs_srv / vfs_server / driver_manager / blkcache_srv / virtio_blk_srv (tids 10000–10005) |
| Strict core-smoke gate | ✅ ordered progression: `_start` → `prepare_arch_boot` → `vbar_el1_ready` → `mmu_enabled` → `run_with_prepared_kernel` → `YARM_BOOT_OK` → `YARM_INIT_START`/`_DONE` |
| Timer / scheduler tick | ✅ `YARM_TIMER_IRQ_DELIVERED` / `YARM_TIMER_EOI_DONE` / `YARM_SCHED_TICK` |
| Optional FS strict smoke | ✅ RAMFS + ext4 live (`RAMFS_MOUNT_READY`, `EXT4_SRV_READY`, `VFS_MOUNT_REGISTER_*_OK`); FAT skipped (`server_disabled`) |
| Steady-state | Expected quiescent idle: `init_server` blocks on `init_alert_recv_ep` after `INIT_ALERT_WAIT_BEGIN`; `process_manager` blocks for more requests |
| SMP / PSCI | Deferred (post-bring-up baseline) |

See `doc/ARCH_AARCH64.md` for the per-PR boot history, IPC contract, PM
exec-load policy, and capability-materialization rules.

### 1.2 x86_64 (PVH — primary; `-smp 1` baseline)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Core-smoke gate (`QEMU_SMP=1`) | ✅ all 6 service entries exactly once; boot markers detected |
| Optional FS strict | ✅ RAMFS + ext4 live; FAT skipped |
| AP Rust online (`yarm.x86_ap_rust=1`) | ✅ Stage 109 outcome A — AP enters Rust and parks |
| Production scheduler | BSP only; `online_cpu_count()` stays at 1; AP `started_secondary` reported separately |
| AP scheduler participation | ❌ deferred — blocked on the AP per-CPU environment (GDT/IDT/TSS + GS base + AP-safe printk + `bring_up_cpu`) |
| Timer interrupts on APs | ❌ APs have no IDT; `cli` stays set; no AP scheduler ticks |

See `doc/ARCH_X86_64.md` for the safety fences, AP marker sequence, BT2
LAPIC timer discipline, and the ordered next-target list before AP
scheduling can be enabled.

### 1.3 RISC-V64 (OpenSBI / QEMU virt)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| OpenSBI handoff | ✅ a0 (hartid) + a1 (DTB) preserved; `mv a0, s1` fix applied |
| Secondary hart park (`--smp 2/3/4`) | ✅ live-verified; boot hart never parked; parked list is the topology bitmap minus the boot hart |
| SMP topology + nonzero boot hart | ✅ binary-FDT `/cpus` walk yields `present_cpus=N`, `present_bitmap=0x{1,3,7,f}`; nonzero OpenSBI boot hart correctly selected (commit 271ac73) |
| Monotonic cmdline capture | ✅ once-guarded; `RISCV_CMDLINE_CAPTURE_ONCE`; `RISCV_CMDLINE_PRESERVED reason=missing_dtb_after_valid` |
| DTB RAM / initrd staging | ✅ `crate::arch::fdt::memory_reg` + `chosen_initrd`; firmware / DTB / initrd reserved |
| Bootstrap | ✅ 16 MiB boot stack; `Bootstrap::init_static`; real RAM staged before allocator init |
| Early S-mode trap diagnostic | ✅ `RISCV_EARLY_TRAP` + `RISCV_BOOTSTRAP_TRAP_STEP` |
| Sv39 kernel-shared gigapage | ✅ root[2] over `[0x8000_0000, 0xC000_0000)` with `V \| R \| W \| X \| G \| A \| D`; idempotent installer |
| Page-table write-through + zero-on-alloc | ✅ MMU walks physical frames, intermediates with `U=0` (Sv39 spec compliance) |
| Real S-mode → U-mode `sret` | ✅ `RISCV_ENTER_USER_SRET tid=2`; first trap `from_u=1 spp=0` |
| Syscall round-trip | ✅ full `RiscvTrapFrame` save/restore; `+4` ecall PC advance via TCB snapshot; task-switch arg seeding; S-mode-fault fail-closed halt |
| Core service chain | ✅ initramfs / devfs / vfs / ramfs / ext4 reached; `RAMFS_MOUNT_READY`; `EXT4_SRV_READY`; `VFS_MOUNT_REGISTER_*_OK` |
| Terminal state | ✅ `RISCV_KERNEL_IDLE_WAITING_FOR_IO reason=no_runnable_task all_services_blocked` (event-driven idle, no timer/IRQ scope) |
| Regular smoke target (`--smp 1/2/3/4`) | ✅ `scripts/qemu-riscv64-core-smoke.sh` + `scripts/qemu-riscv64-smoke-matrix.sh` enforce the full per-N marker contract on QEMU virt + OpenSBI |
| Timer interrupt (live) | ⏸ deferred — accepted as `RISCV_TIMER_DEFERRED reason=timer_irq_feature_disabled`; next pass enables S-mode timer (`stimecmp` + `sstatus.SIE=1` + `mideleg` STI) and flips the gate to live-required |
| PLIC threshold write under active satp | ✅ skipped + reported as `RISCV_PLIC_DEFERRED reason=plic_mmio_unmapped_under_active_satp` (PLIC MMIO is outside the kernel-shared gigapage; raw write would fault) |
| External IRQ enable | ⏸ deferred — `RISCV_EXTIRQ_DEFERRED reason=no_safe_source`; UART0 (sid=10) is the marked candidate, no source enabled in this pass |
| SMP scheduler | ⏸ off — `RISCV_SCHEDULER_BSP_ONLY online_cpus=1 reason=riscv_smp_scheduler_not_enabled`; `online_cpus` stays at 1 until RISC-V SMP scheduling lands |

See `doc/ARCH_RISCV64.md` for the full marker sequence, ABI mapping, and
SMP blocker list.

### 1.4 Raspberry Pi 5 (diagnostic only — not production)

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Stage 1 UART / DTB / MMU / allocator / read-only timer + GIC | ✅ live diagnostic |
| Stage 2A–2D | ✅ live diagnostic; EL0 entry deferred at Stage 2D (`ttbr_split_not_ready`) |
| HH-2 (TTBR split, MMU on, branch to high alias) | ✅ live diagnostic; non-default `rpi5-highhalf` feature |
| HH-3 (high-linked Rust continuation) | ✅ live diagnostic |
| HH-4 (low-identity retirement) | ✅ live diagnostic |
| HH-5 (real userspace) | ❌ DEFERRED — `RPI5_HH5_DEFERRED reason=high_half_initrd_allocator_bridge_not_ready` |

Current next blocker: build the high-half initrd / allocator bridge so
HH-5 can consume the existing Stage 2C loader without violating HH-4's
no-low-VA contract.

See `doc/RPI5_BRINGUP.md` for the full Stage 1A → HH-5 sequence and the
hardware artifact-build commands.

## 2. Per-service status

### 2.1 Bootstrap chain (image IDs 1–3)

| tid | service | status |
|-----|---------|--------|
| 1 | `init_server` | ✅ live; reaches steady-state event-driven idle on every arch with U-mode |
| 2 | `supervisor` | ✅ live; handoff banner emitted; control / fault / control-send caps present |
| 3 | `process_manager` | ✅ live; SpawnV5 path proven; PM-private reply RECEIVE cap in startup slot 2 |

Slots 0..17 are documented in `doc/PROCESS_AND_SPAWN.md` (slot 12
is PM-private for PM↔VFS subcalls).

### 2.2 Bootstrap FS chain (image IDs 4–6)

| tid (typical) | service | status |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| 10000 | `initramfs_srv` | ✅ live; `INITRAMFS_BACKEND_SOURCE source=cpio` populated from boot CPIO bytes |
| 10001 | `devfs_srv` | ✅ live; console / null FDs registered; `DEVFS_SRV_RESIDENT_WAIT_BEGIN` |
| 10002 | `vfs_server` | ✅ live; `VFS_MOUNT_TABLE_READY`; routes initramfs + devfs sends |

### 2.3 Optional FS / storage (image IDs 7–12)

| Image ID | Service | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 7 | `driver_manager` | ✅ live; spawned via VFS-backed `STATX → OPENAT → READ* → CLOSE` after init passes a `vfs_server` request SEND cap (SpawnV5 service caps slot 0) |
| 8 | `blkcache_srv` | ✅ live |
| 9 | `virtio_blk_srv` | ✅ live |
| 10 | `fat_srv` | Profile-ready; **disabled by default** (`INIT_FAT_SPAWN_SKIPPED reason=server_disabled`); see `doc/FILESYSTEM_AND_STORAGE_CONTRACTS.md` (FAT server section) for activation blockers |
| 11 | `ramfs_srv` | ✅ live; fully writable; mounted at `/ram` |
| 12 | `ext4_srv` | ✅ live; read-only; mounted at `/ext4` (writes report `Unsupported`) |

The optional-FS strict smoke pins these markers per arch — see
`doc/KERNEL_UNLOCKING.md` §3 ("Optional-FS smoke markers"). Do not
rename or remove them without updating both smoke scripts.

### 2.4 Networking

Service domain crate exists (`crates/yarm-network-servers`) with
contracts consolidated into `doc/NETWORKING.md` (Pass 4). Not part
of the core boot smoke.

### 2.5 UI

Service domain crate exists (`crates/yarm-ui-servers`). Not part of the
core boot smoke. Current contracts live in `doc/PHASE_GATES.md`
(Phase 4 UI contract section; gated by `scripts/check-roadmap-readiness.sh`).

---

## 3. Current crate / domain boundary

Kernel and low-level runtime own:

- scheduling and dispatch mechanisms;
- IPC / notification mechanisms;
- capability enforcement / mechanisms;
- trap / IRQ routing mechanisms;
- VM / address-space and bootstrap mechanisms.

Userspace service domains own service policy (extracted workspace crates):

| Domain | Crate path |
|--------|------------|
| Control plane | `crates/yarm-control-plane-servers` |
| Drivers | `crates/yarm-driver-servers` |
| Filesystems | `crates/yarm-fs-servers` |
| Networking | `crates/yarm-network-servers` |
| UI | `crates/yarm-ui-servers` |
| Compatibility | `crates/yarm-compat-servers` |
| Shared service helper/runtime | `crates/yarm-srv-common` |

The root `yarm` crate is no longer the monolithic service owner.
Boundary checks enforce crate-graph and source-shape constraints:

```sh
scripts/check-crate-graph-boundary.py
scripts/phase5-boundary-gates.sh
scripts/phase5-boundary-gates.sh --fs-runtime-entrypoint
scripts/phase5-boundary-gates.sh --driver-runtime-entrypoint
scripts/phase5-boundary-gates.sh --network-runtime-entrypoint
scripts/phase5-boundary-gates.sh --ui-runtime-entrypoint
```

`yarm-server-runtime` is a narrow server-runtime boundary; see
`doc/AGENTS.md` for the export-surface contract.

## 5. Current top next steps

The four highest-impact items, in order of unlock value:

1. **RISC-V S-mode timer interrupt (live path) + smoke-gate tightening.**
   The regular RISC-V core smoke now passes live across `--smp 1/2/3/4`
   on the deferred branch (timer / PLIC / external IRQ all reported with
   explicit `reason=` markers). Next, enable `stimecmp` via the SBI Timer
   extension, set `sstatus.SIE=1`, delegate `STI` in `mideleg`, then
   flip the smoke gate's `RISCV_TIMER_SMOKE_OK|RISCV_TIMER_DEFERRED`
   accept-regex from "either" to "live required". PLIC + external-IRQ
   follow the same flip; once both land, queue RISC-V into the global
   kernel-unlocking smoke policy and unblock RISC-V SMP scheduling so
   `online_cpus` can climb past 1. See `doc/ARCH_RISCV64.md` §10–11.

2. **x86_64 AP per-CPU environment.** Per-CPU GDT/IDT/TSS + GS base +
   AP-safe printk + `bring_up_cpu(cpu)` integration, behind a default-off
   knob; then `-smp ≥ 2` smoke acceptance. Lock-free
   `await_tlb_shootdown_ack` and per-CPU runqueue lock sharding (D6)
   follow once scheduler-online APs exist. See `doc/ARCH_X86_64.md` §4
   and `doc/KERNEL_UNLOCKING.md` §7.

3. **RPi5 HH-5 — high-half initrd / allocator bridge.** Build the bridge
   so HH-5 can consume the existing Stage 2C loader without violating
   HH-4's no-low-VA contract; then enter EL0 via the real ERET path. See
   `doc/RPI5_BRINGUP.md` §12–13.

4. **Documentation consolidation Pass 4 — completed 2026-06-15.** Six
   ABI-sensitive clusters (IPC, VFS, FS/storage, networking, capabilities,
   process/spawn) and the six CI-gated phase docs were consolidated into
   seven canonical owners (`doc/IPC.md`, `doc/VFS.md`,
   `doc/FILESYSTEM_AND_STORAGE_CONTRACTS.md`, `doc/NETWORKING.md`,
   `doc/CAPABILITY_MODEL.md`, `doc/PROCESS_AND_SPAWN.md`,
   `doc/PHASE_GATES.md`). CI gate scripts were updated atomically. See
   `doc/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md`.

## 6. Frozen boundaries (one-line reminders)

The full invariant list lives in `doc/KERNEL_UNLOCKING.md` §3. Headlines:

- SpawnV5 ABI (16-byte reply, argument layout) — frozen.
- Image IDs 7–12 — frozen.
- `SYSCALL_COUNT = 31`; `STARTUP_SLOT_COUNT = 18`.
- `RecvSharedV3` ABI offsets — frozen.
- Optional-FS smoke markers (`INIT_RAMFS_SPAWN_OK`, `RAMFS_MOUNT_READY`,
  `VFS_MOUNT_REGISTER_RAMFS_OK`, `INIT_EXT4_SPAWN_OK`, `EXT4_SRV_ENTRY`,
  `EXT4_SRV_READY`, `VFS_MOUNT_REGISTER_EXT4_OK`,
  `INIT_FAT_SPAWN_SKIPPED reason=server_disabled`) — do not rename or
  remove.
- No `ipc_recv_with_deadline(_, 0)` in required-reply paths.
- `VFS_SUPERVISOR_TASK_EXIT_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED = false`.
- VM / TLB two-phase ordering (PTE removal → TLB shootdown → reclaim).
- Boundary gates (`phase5-boundary-gates`) remain green.
- No service-policy logic in the kernel; no reintroduction of
  `src/services/*`.

## 7. Authoring rule

Do **not** turn this file into a milestone diary. Append a row to
`doc/PROJECT_HISTORY.md` for a closed milestone; update the rows above
to reflect the new live state; link the next-target details to the
canonical owner doc. New status / next-context / audit / PR-plan
fragment files are forbidden — see `doc/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md`.

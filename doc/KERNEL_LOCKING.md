# Kernel locking model audit (current) and decomposition plan

This document records the current kernel locking shape and a staged plan to
remove implicit global-lock coupling from syscall/trap paths.

## 1) Current global lock boundary (`SharedKernel`)

`src/runtime.rs` wraps `KernelState` in a single `SpinLock<KernelState>`:

- `SharedKernel::with(...)` acquires the global kernel lock for the full closure.
- `SharedKernel::with_cpu(...)` also acquires the same global lock.

As a result, all operations executed through `SharedKernel` are serialized at
the top-level lock boundary before any subsystem `SpinLockIrq` is reached.

## 2) Current `KernelState` lock-bearing fields

`KernelState` currently owns the following lock fields:

- `scheduler_state: SpinLockIrq<SchedulerState>`
- `ipc_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `driver_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `fault_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `restart_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `capability_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `telemetry_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `boot_config_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `vm_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `task_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`
- `memory_state_lock: SpinLockIrq<()>`

## 3) Current lock-touch map for common paths

### 3.1 Syscall/trap dispatch entry

- Syscalls dispatch through `src/kernel/syscall.rs::dispatch(...)` and then call
  into `KernelState` helpers.
- In runtime-hosted paths, these operations are typically entered through
  `SharedKernel::with(...)` (global lock first), then subsystem locks inside
  `KernelState` helpers.

### 3.2 Subsystem lock families touched by common operations

- **Scheduler/task state**
  - `scheduler_state_lock` via scheduler helpers
  - `task_state_lock` via TCB/task metadata access
- **IPC/endpoints**
  - `ipc_state_lock`
- **Capabilities**
  - `capability_state_lock`
- **VM/address spaces**
  - `vm_state_lock`
- **Memory objects / user-memory helpers**
  - `memory_state_lock`
- **Driver metadata/recovery**
  - `driver_state_lock`
- **Fault/restart/timers/telemetry**
  - `fault_state_lock`, `restart_state_lock`, `telemetry_state_lock`
  - timer access currently hangs off scheduler state in `SchedulerState`

## 4) Proposed mandatory lock ordering (documentation baseline)

The following order should be treated as mandatory for any nested lock
acquisition to prevent future lock-order inversions:

1. **Global runtime lock**: `SharedKernel.state` (if present in that path)
2. `scheduler_state_lock`
3. `task_state_lock`
4. `ipc_state_lock`
5. `capability_state_lock`
6. `vm_state_lock`
7. `memory_state_lock`
8. `driver_state_lock`
9. `fault_state_lock`
10. `restart_state_lock`
11. `telemetry_state_lock`
12. `boot_config_state_lock`

Rationale:

- scheduler/task tend to gate run-state decisions;
- IPC/capability are frequently coupled in syscall paths;
- VM/memory/driver/fault/restart are progressively more specialized.

If a path cannot follow this order, it should be called out explicitly and
handled via a dedicated helper with clear lock-contract comments.

## 5) Staged decomposition plan

### Stage 0 (now): document current behavior and lock order

- Keep global `SharedKernel` lock behavior unchanged.
- Treat this document as source of truth for lock order and review checks.

### Stage 1: add lock-contract helpers/assertions

- Introduce small no-nesting or lock-level assertions where possible.
- Ensure multi-lock helpers encode intended order centrally.

### Stage 2: split high-traffic subsystem lock domains

- Prioritize decomposition across scheduler/task/ipc/vm hot paths.
- Minimize cross-subsystem lock hold durations.

### Stage 3: remove global lock from syscall fast path

- Route trap/syscall dispatch directly to subsystem locks where safe.
- Keep global lock only for coarse-grain control-plane operations, if needed.

### Stage 4: per-CPU scheduler/runqueue locking

- Move scheduler queues and CPU-local runnable state to per-CPU lock domains.
- Retain cross-CPU coordination only for explicit migration/work-queue paths.

## 6) Scope note

This document is audit/design-only and does not change runtime lock behavior.
